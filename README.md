# CSS - Chocolate Pizza

## Outline
This assignment is meant to simulate a real world HTML and CSS project.  Read the following overview and instructions in their entirety before beginning.

## Assignment Overview

Your boss comes up to you just before lunch: "OK, we just picked up this job, but I need it on my desk (well, in my inbox) in a week. It doesn't need to be perfect... it needs to be as close to perfect as you can get it in that time."

In lab this week you will be building a single webpage based off of the provided design comp (aka mockup) assets. This assignment is focused on HTML and CSS. If you would like to add a small bit of JS near the end of the project as a primer for next week, feel free to add this as a stretch goal for yourself.

## Instructions

It is your job to create a page that looks ***exactly*** like the preview below. Within your GitHub class repo, under today's directory, you will find all of the assets required to accomplish this task in addition to a larger version of this preview image.

Use your notes from class, your readings, partner, classmates, and the internet to assist with the completion of the lab. Research what you need and don't be afraid to try different techniques.

Create a new repository called **chocolate-pizza**. You will be working with a partner on this project. Be sure to do frequent commits, and always do your work on branches. There should be a new branch for each day. Merge your work before the end of each day. Before starting coding, think about a strategy for approaching this project. Before writing code, think about a practical order in which to do the work:

- When should you focus on styling?
- When should you make a decision about a layout scheme?
- When should you just build out the structure of the HTML?

Suggestion: Set up your work directory like this:

- index.html
- style.css
- img/   *(a directory that contains all of your image assets)*

If you want to rename any of the image files, feel free to do so. The same goes for pretty much anything else you come up with as a way to do the work.

## Resources

Refer to the daily class repo for your assets required for this lab as well as a larger version of the preview image located above.

## Requirements
Today is all about planning.  After you have created a GitHub repo, added your partner as a collaborator, cloned down the repo, made a starter branch, and created your `index.html` and `style.css` files, ACP those back to GitHub.

## Submission
Submit a link to your starter repo.  You will begin coding tomorrow.
